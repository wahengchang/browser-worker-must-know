It is an implementation of how worker works no browser. 

## What is worker ?
 - Web Workers is a simple means for web content to run scripts in __*background threads*__. The worker thread can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface. 
 - Data is sent between workers and the main thread via a __*system of messages*__ â€” both sides send their messages using the `postMessage()` method, and respond to messages via the `onmessage`
